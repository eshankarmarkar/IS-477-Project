"1 Since 2003, federal surveys have allowed respondents to report more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using both approaches. Since Hispanic individuals may be any race, data for the Hispanic population overlap with data for race groups. Of those who reported only one race in the 2025 CPS ASEC, Hispanic origin was reported by 17.9 percent of White householders, 6.4 percent of Black householders, 2.5 percent of Asian householders, and 35.9 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native householders. Data users should be aware that the different race and Hispanic origin populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and nativity, which may affect the interpretation of aggregate results. Data on Hispanic origin were first collected in 1972. Data on Asian and Pacific Islander origin and American Indian and Alaska Native origin were first collected in 1987. Estimates for Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders are not shown separately due to sample size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights beginning with 2010. Before 2010, standard errors were calculated using the generalized variance function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"5 The 2014 CPS ASEC included redesigned questions for income and health insurance coverage. All of the approximately 98,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned set of health insurance coverage questions. The redesigned income questions were implemented to a subsample of these 98,000 addresses using a probability split panel design. Approximately 68,000 addresses were eligible to receive a set of income questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC and the remaining 30,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned income questions. The source of these 2013 estimates is the portion of the CPS ASEC sample that received the redesigned income questions, approximately 30,000 addresses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limits either increased or decreased in the following categories: earnings limits increased to $999,999; Social Security limits increased to $49,999; Supplemental Security Income and public assistance limits increased to $24,999; veterans' benefits limits increased to $99,999; child support and alimony limits decreased to $49,999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
